# Design Guide

## Direction
Retro-futurist, monochrome-first UI with bold outlines and tactile cards. Inspired by the "Mac" template image: chunky typography, window-like frames, and a friendly, mechanical vibe.

## Color Palette
- Paper: #F6F2EA (primary background)
- Ink: #0F0F0F (primary text and borders)
- Muted: #5E5B55 (secondary text)
- Accent: #C8FF47 (primary call-to-action)
- Accent 2: #FF7A59 (optional highlights)

## Typography
- Primary: Space Grotesk (headings + body)
- Mono: Space Mono (labels, technical notes)
- Style: bold headlines, tight tracking, compact blocks

## Layout & Spacing
- Max width: 1120px
- Section padding: 48–64px
- Cards: 16–24px internal padding
- Use consistent gaps (16/24/32px) and grid-based layouts

## Components
- Cards: 2px solid borders, slight shadow, warm paper background
- Buttons: rounded pill, bold border, accent fill with crisp shadow
- Badges: small pill with accent background and ink text
- Navigation: sticky, minimal, with a clear Contact CTA

## Imagery
- Thumbnails cropped consistently for grid rhythm
- Lightbox for full-size detail inspection
- Prefer medium contrast and neutral background colors

## Motion
- Light hover lifts on buttons and cards
- Avoid heavy or excessive animation
